const price = products.find(({id}) => id == cv.productId).price;

1. products.find()

find() is a method that is part of the Array prototype in JavaScript. It allows you to iterate over an array and return the first element that matches a certain condition.
In this case, products is an array of objects, and find() is being called on it. The method takes a callback function as an argument, which will be executed for each element in the array.

2. ({id}) => id == cv.productId

This is the callback function that is being passed to find(). It's an arrow function that takes an object with an id property as an argument.
Here's what's happening in this function:

({id}) is using destructuring to extract the id property from the object that is being passed to the function. This is equivalent to writing function(obj) { var id = obj.id; ... }.
id == cv.productId is the condition that is being checked. It's comparing the id property of the object to the productId property of the cv object.
The == operator is used for loose equality checking, which means that it will return true if the values are equal, even if they are not of the same type. For example, 5 == '5' would return true.

3. .price

If the condition id == cv.productId is true, the find() method will return the entire object that matches the condition. The .price property is then accessed on that object to retrieve the price value.

So, when we put all these parts together, here's what happens:

products.find() iterates over the products array and calls the callback function for each element.
The callback function checks if the id property of the element matches the productId property of the cv object.
If a match is found, the find() method returns the entire object that matches the condition.
The .price property is then accessed on that object to retrieve the price value, which is assigned to the price variable.
Here's an example to illustrate this:

Suppose products is an array of objects like this:

json
[
  { id: 1, price: 10.99 },
  { id: 2, price: 5.99 },
  { id: 3, price: 7.99 }
]
And cv is an object with a productId property like this:

{ productId: 2 }
When we call products.find(({id}) => id == cv.productId).price, the find() method will iterate over the products array and check each element's id property against the productId property of the cv object.

When it finds a match (in this case, the second element with id equal to 2), it will return that entire object, and then access the .price property to retrieve the price value, which is 5.99. This value is then assigned to the price variable

The same with const price = products.find((el) => el.id == cv.productId).price;

Programmatic route - programmatically navigating between routes
const navigate = useNavigate(); // useNavigate is a hook from react-router-dom
const handleCardOpen = () => {
    navigate(`/product-detail/${id}`);
  };
toaster - react-hot-toast for noti and alert
sweetalert2
URL param
{
  path: "product-detail/:productId",
  element: <ProductDetail />,
}, why there is a : in "product-detail/:productId"


In React Router, the colon (:) is used to indicate a URL parameter. In this case, :productId is a URL parameter that will be passed to the ProductDetail component.

This means that when a user navigates to a URL like /product-detail/123, the productId parameter will be set to 123. The ProductDetail component can then access this parameter using the useParams hook, as seen in the ProductDetail component code (src/pages/ProductDetail.jsx:ProductDetail):
const { productId } = useParams();
This allows the ProductDetail component to render the details of the product with the specified ID.

Day 9 -
filter by category -
const currentCategory = categories.find((category) => category.isActive == true);
{products.filter(el => currentCategory == "all" || el.category == currentCategory).map((product) => (
  <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
))}
showing url via slug -
must have slug on each element of products array
change router.js param to slug
api -
https://rapidapi.com/learn/rest#what-is-an-api
http - 80, https - 443
config ml so header lo - Content-Type:"application/json"
JSON - javascript object notation
no comma after last element, quote all string elements
Json Server -
json must be start with object, and in this object must have key, and value array of elements
example  - {"tasks": [{...},{...}]}
post man REST api CRUD

Day 10 -
if you know the endpoint, can request the data from postman or browser or terminal
for security purposes, we need to limit the place it can be accessed from
curl https://api.fastforex.io/fetch-all?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
curl https://api.fastforex.io/fetch-all?api_key=d84611ce79-f69a495ac2-sif3cv
Controlling access with an api key, but it has an effet of everyone can see the key in the url
Log in, register and get an api key(token) with mmsit contact application

api fetching
web api > fetch api
promise(read in detail)
fetch(url) - we need to wait for the data to arrive so it's a promise. use .then((response) => {console.log(response)}) to get the data after it arrives.
it returns a response object, in which we can get the data by .json() or .text(), but it still arrive in promise so we need another .then().
fetch("http://localhost:5000/tasks")
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((data) => clg(data))
it is text so we can't do much processing with the data so we need to use JSON.parse().
alternatively, we can use .json() in the response object
fetch("http://localhost:5000/tasks")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => clg(data))
we can get the data from any api endpoint using this.

Day 11 -
to run the json-server from npm command, package.json>scripts>api>json-server tasks.json -d 1000 -p 5000
sync-async
sync - one by one, in order, file_get_contents() in php
async - all start at the same time and end whichever end first, fetch() in js, and unusually, built-in object promise is async
in JS, web api are async processes and the rest are sync processes
if you need to check the store stock and return the data, you need to make a request to the server then wait for the response. if you coded in a way that you return the data immediately, the initial value will be returned, not the actual stock, it is due to async nature. we need to make sure that it is sync nature.
Promise Object - 
const p = new Promise(), executor function as param, function executor(resolve, reject), two functions as params of executor.\
const p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  ......... do something
  if (success)  resolve(data)
  else reject(data)
})
it's a promise so we can use .then() to catch the data after background process is done
p.then(resolve function, reject function)
p.then(
  function(x) {clg("success", x)},
  function(y) {clg("fail", y)}
)
if we want fetch() api to behave like sync, we need to write them inside one another .then resolve function, it get pretty messy soon
async await -
declare the function as async function - async function() { await }
then await the promise, got response obj with data in it being promise, await the reponse data promise againg and get the data
it schedule the the parallel running asyn processes in the function so that it look like it's sync,
but under the hood, it's still async (async/await scheduling)
Errors - logic error, sentence error, runtime error(calling not defined variables, functions etc)
Exception Handling -
try {
  do something
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e)
} finally {
  console.log("ill show there's error or not")
}

Day 12 - 
useEffect() - syntax - useEffect(af, dependency array) - useEffect(() => {}, [])
pure function has no side effect, useEffect() runs when the component is mounted to the view and normally contains non-pure functions, or functions that need to be run as soon as the component is rendered.
make another useState for loading (true, false) and show loading animation according to the state.
CRUD for json-server
spinny loading ball - https://uiball.com/ldrs/

Delete skeleton loading -
const [deleting, setDeleting] = useState({});
why? because we need to know the id of the task to show the loading animation on that task, so we can't use the normal loading useState(flase)
then while setting the state, 
setDeleting({[id]: true})
[id] is the dynamic property name or computed property name, it is a way to create the property name using a variable.
// deleting code ....
setDeleting({[id]: false})
in Task component check with if(deleting && deleting[id]) then return the loading animation component.
why (deleting && deleting[id])? because checking the object exists or not before accessing it, is the common pattern and help prevents runtime errors.
The same applied to checkbox loading ui ball

Day 13 -
Revision
JS paradigm
React - view - react node
React-dom - render
JSX
prop - prop drilling hell
React-router-dom
hook
State - useState() - one way data binding, parent to child only
Local State - declare in this component and use in this component
App State - root component state, declare in root component and use in other components, one change in one component view in other component, prop drilling hell
Context Api (Global State) - Provider - context hell
zustand (Global State) - hook
Global State -
All the state are in the RAM, not persistent, only runtime, not save to local storage, no data after reload, local device
Server State -
Backend
API - REST API
Json-server
no real time, only request-response
not the same of server data and client data, so need to revalidate the data, fetch the data again after adding or changing the data from another client(browser, mobile, etc) to the server
if you open the to-do api in two browsers and add one thing in chrome, it will show in chrome as new task, and if you add another task in firefox, it, the task you added from firefox, will only show in firefox as new task, which means you can't see the task added from chrome in firefox. The data is there on the json-server, not in the browser. That's why we need to revalidate the data. (fetch the server data again)
SWR- Stale-while-revalidate
When you use SWR to fetch data from an API, SWR will cache the response in RAM or in browser cache, to save from making a new network request. Cached data is stored in key-value store, typically with api endpoint as key and response as value. So if you call SWR with a specific key, it will check the cache for that key, if there's one, it will return from the cached data.
SWR use a technique call stale-while-revalidate, if the cached data is stale(older than a certain time), it will send a background request to fetch latest data from the srver. 
const {} = useSWR("endpoint", fetcher_function); return object with data, error, isLoading properties.
const {data, error, isLoading} = useSWR("endpoint", fetcher_function);
fetcher - const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then(res => res.json())
it will show the data after the loading is done(isLoading == false)
Powerful function of swr is auto-revalidation
const {mutate} = useSWRConfig();
mutate("endpoint") - mutate refetch the data from endpoint and update the cached data(in the RAM or in the browser cache) with new response, it can be done manually to update the cache only with mutate("endpoint", newData)

axios - library to make http requests, simpler and more intuitive than fetch(), promise based, easy to use, easy to do exception handling
how it works -
1. make an instance of axios by importing the library and using axios funtion.
2. configure the instance via passing an options object to the axios instance with baseURL, headers, etc
3. use the instance to make http requests by calling methods on the instance, like get(), post(), put(), delete(), etc
4. handle the response - axios receives the response from the server and parses it into the JS object.
5. Returning the response - return the response to the caller, which can then be used to extract data, handle errors, etc.

Code examples
1. import axios from 'axios';
2. const toDoApi = axios.create({
    baseURL: `${import.meta.env.VITE_TODO_API}/tasks`,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
  });
3.,4. const addTask = async (newTask) => {
    const response = await toDoApi.post("/", newTask);
    // return response.data;
    mutate(`${import.meta.env.VITE_TODO_API}/tasks`);
  };


import axios from 'axios';
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

.env file - the file to store environment variables, such as API endpoints, API keys, etc.
The pros of env file is if you switch the environment like from local to production, you won't need to change every endpoints, keys, etc, just change in the .env file one place and your software will run in the new environment.
!!! .env file must be in the .gitignore file, so that it won't be uploaded to github.
.env.example - example of .env file, can be used as a template (original one is .gitignore)

.env.local - local development environment variables
.env.test - test environment variables
.env.prod - production environment variables

Day 14 -
Why we need software?

To hide normally and show only if it is empty, last row of table

Day 15 -
populate json data
.env added
run json-server for data persistent
implement swr for data fetching and displaying
add skeleton loading for product list
breakdown the product list into smaller components so that we can render efficiently
render with actual data and change format of date and time(by using Date Object's toLocaleDateString() and toLocaleTimeString())
handleDeleteBtn with fetch()
Add loading animation for delete button, (del btn being icon btn we can change it to size-10 instead of px and py so that we can easily adjust ldrs animation component size )
Create a new page for Add new product btn
Fix Breadcrumb - pass an array, in it a object with title and path, as prop e.g.links, call the links and loop it to general new dir.
Make UI for create product form
useForm hook - 
previously we use state to hold input data, it is time consuming and tedious
with useForm hook, we can easily catch the data when the form is submited and can do validation easily
usage of useForm hook - https://www.react-hook-form.com/get-started#Quickstart
const {register, handleSubmit, formState: {errors}} = useForm()
showing data, form validation, showing error msg
add timestamp to data from form
send data to json-server
add loading animation for submit btn
implement react hot toast and make it toast on submit success(read the documentation carefully)
reset the form after submit
toast for product delete
add back to product list checkbox and implement the code to do programmatic route back to productList page
modify the data sent to server, remove unnecessary one.

Day 16 -
Make a form for the customer info and voucher id
copy from the product card label and input, then implement useForm()
default value for date and voucher id
Two components for the product form and product list table
VoucherInfo > SaleForm > VoucherTable
we need to send the state data between the two components, so we need to use global state. 

saleForm has the product_id for the option, but we need to get the product name or price etc.
normally we have to retrace them from the fetched data via product_id user has selected.
So we will give the whole product object as the value for the option tag but we can't do that because js obj will not be shown in the html, [Object Object] only.
So we need to turn that object into string by JSON.stringify().
Then change the useForm register("product_id") to register("product").
Then we can get the product string and parse it to get the product object in formData.

<option key={product.id} value={JSON.stringify(product)}>
  {product.product_name}
</option>

const onSubmit = (formData) => {
  const currentProduct = JSON.parse(formData.product)
  console.log({
    product_id: currentProduct.id,
    product_name: currentProduct.product_name,
    price: currentProduct.price,
    quantity: formData.quantity,
    cost: formData.quantity * currentProduct.price,
  });
};

Day 17 -
github issues, and project

Day 18 -
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(..args).then((res) => res.json());
while defining the fetcher function, = (...args) => is called rest parameter, it will collect all argu into an array called args.
When calling the fetch function, fetch(...args),then() is called spread parameter, it will spread the array args into individual arguments for the fetch function, as if they werer passed separatedly.

Day 19 -
Voucher UI change
json-server filter function, _gte, _lte, order, like (see json-server documentation)
voucher_search
put input value into "search" useState value then handle function with onChange then if search  exists, swr string is search query, if not all query
one problem, onChange on input so it will fetch every action user take on input, it will be a strain on api server
Throttling and Debouncing
Using loadash
Throttling - will run the function on every set timeframe
Debouncing - will run the function after executing the code inside, delaying set timeframe
useRef - DOM element ko refrence yuu tae hook
  const handleSearch = throttle((e) => {
    setSearch(e.target.value);
  }, 500);

  const handleClearSearch = () => {
    setSearch("")
  }

  <input value={search} />

  {
    search && <button onClick={handleClearSearch}>Clear</button>
  }
This approach works well with the throttle but in debounce
  const handleSearch = debounce((e) => {
    setSearch(e.target.value)
  }, 500)

  const handleClearSearch = () => {
    setSearch("")
  }

  <input value={search} />

  {
    search && <button onClick={handleClearSearch}>Clear</button>
  }
It won't work well because while waiting 500ms after typing, input element value property is set to search (which is "") then setSearch become setSearch("") and so on. Thus, we need to grab the element and change value without html value property.
So we use useRef() hook to refrence the input element and get the value to clear the input.

Day 20 -
With laravel api, endpoint, https://voucher-app-api.ygnsh.com/api/v1
When dealing with laravel api, you need to know a few things beforehand, in post put 
Accept - application/json         -- we are accepting json msg response
Content-Type - application/json   -- we are sending json msg request
API supports search, sort, for pagination (individual pages, prev, next, total counts, to and from)
async hmr data ma shi pl code ka a lote lote ny yin error tat ml
ae tot, ?. operator nae lote loh ya tl, shi hma lote ml ma shi yin ma lote vu
data?.length, data?.[0]?.id, data?.data?.id
const res = await fetch(endpoint, {method: "GET"});
res.status - to check the status of the response
Product Page, change all the endpoints for RUD and search
in Day 19, we change SWR endpoint with ? `` : ``, but today we change it with useState like this
  const [fetchUrl, setFetchUrl] = useState(
    `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/products`
  );
so that we can use that in future if needed (and more appropriate)
Pagination - prev and next are in {links} and all links, total entries, to, from are in {meta}
we previously set the fetchUrl with useState in productList so we pass that useState into the pagination component
but it seems a bit taw thr san so we will make updateFetchUrl = (url) => setFetchUrl(url) and pass that into the pagination
Voucher page,
{!isLoading &&
data?.data?.map((voucher, index) => (
  <VoucherListRow key={index} voucher={voucher} />
))}
one fatal flaw of using map index as key is when deleting a voucher, it will delete the voucher but as the array contents changes, that index will be occupy with new content, so it will be shown as a bug in ui.
Using the index of the map function as the key prop, like key={index}, can have a negative effect on the performance and correctness of your React application.

When you use the index as the key, React will use the index to identify each component in the array. However, if the array changes (e.g., items are added or removed), the index of each item will also change. This can cause React to:
  1. Re-render unnecessary components: When the index changes, React will re-render all components, even if their underlying data hasn't changed.
  2. Cause incorrect component state: If a component's state is tied to its index, changing the index can cause the state to become inconsistent.
  3. Lead to bugs: In some cases, using the index as the key can lead to bugs that are difficult to track down.
Instead, it's recommended to use a unique identifier for each item in the array, such as a id or uuid property. This ensures that each component has a stable key, even if the array changes.
In laravel, if we created a entry successfully, the response status code is 201, not 200.

Day 21 Part 2 -
saving Token Auth in global state.
in line 188, Global State -
All the state are in the RAM, not persistent, only runtime, not save to local storage, no data after reload, local device.
So we need to save the token to local storage.
Local Storage vs Session Storage vs Cookies 
can only store strings, so if we want to store the obj or array, we need to use JSON.stringify().
Local Storage - store data without exp date, data is shared across all tabs and window of the same origin (domain, protocol, port)
Session Storage - store data for a single session (browser session), data is not shared across all tabs or window of the same origin (domain, protocol, port)
Cookies - store data with exp date, data is shared across all tabs and window of the same origin (domain, protocol, port), everytime we request to the server, Cookies will be sent to the server. server can also send cookie back to the client, so we can use cookie to identify the user, like token.

Cookie Setter
const setCookie = (name, value, daysToExpire) => {
  const date = new Date();
  date.setTime(date.getTime() + daysToExpire * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const expires = "expires=" + date.toUTCString();
  document.cookie = name + "=" + value + ";" + expires + ";path=/"; // name=value;expires=....;path=/
};

setCookie("hello", "MOM", 3);
getTime() is used instead of getDate() because getTime() returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC), whereas getDate() returns the day of the month (1-31).
In this case, you want to add a certain number of days to the current date, and then convert that to a timestamp. getTime() provides a timestamp that can be easily manipulated by adding milliseconds.
